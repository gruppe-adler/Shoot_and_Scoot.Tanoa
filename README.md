### Artillery
The task of the **artillery** crews is to destroy all enemy resupply stations and win the game for the own team.

In order to find those stations they and **all other players** can utilize small UAVs.


### Sound directionfinders
The crews of the **sound directionfinders** can use their vehicles as sensors that point into the direction of where artillery has been fired from. 

They need to place these sensors wisely in order to enable accurate triangulation of enemy artillery batteries.


### Hunter-Killer teams
Hunter-Killer teams are very mobile motorized infantery teams that are meant to hunt down enemy artillery crews when they reveal their position through firing.

In addition they employ explosives as decoys (also shows up on directionfinder screens) and in order to take down resupply points.


### Side Commander
The commander is the top-most leader of one side and the only person that that is not a directionfinder operator but still sees the sensors bearings.
