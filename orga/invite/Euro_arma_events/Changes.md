## Changes since last game night

### Buffed
* EW operator (of Hunter Killer teams); can now **listen in to any radio communication**
* Darter drones (of Recon elements); restored **laser designator** functionality
  * for easier target pinpointing on the map (ACE feature)
  * needed for targeting of the commanders Cruise missiles (see below)
* Commanders; can fire **[Cruise Missile](https://armedassault.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Liberty#MK41_VLS)** from nearby destroyer
  * only 1x missile for starters (to test impact on balancing)
  * requires laser designation by Darter drone
  * comes with video feed during flight
    * example here: https://i.imgur.com/Pk8aHDM.jpeg


### Nerfed
* Sensor truck (of Recon elements); does **no longer show bearing towards enemy radio calls** (but still points to enemy artillery fire)
  * everyone agreed that this feature was overpowered during last playthrough

### Quality of life and balancing
* added **scripted workarounds** for common problems
  * mortars disappearing upon unload
  * drone AI occasionally losing ability for autonomous movement
* added [ingame documentation](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/Shoot_and_Scoot.Tanoa/issues/43#issuecomment-2234439987)
* enabled **stealing of radios from killed enemies** 
  * doesn't make sense to keep prohibiting this if EW operator can listen in
* removed LG (and illumination) shells from D30 artillery
  * arti gunners often fired illumination and other shells once HE was empty
  * smoke shells still present though
