# Shelltracker

This module allows qualified players (currenlty only curators) to better track artillery shells.

## Features
- Shows a message whenever a player fires an artillery round.
- Visualizes shells in-flight on the map, as well as a lingering marker on the impact site including a radius marker for 95% effective blast range.
